    <h1>GIS Portfolio - Randall Scharpf</h1>
    <p>
        I've been taking a group of classes in <b>Geographic Information Systems (GIS)</b> at UCLA. I've been
        analyzing geospatial information using a variety of different techniques and creating maps to
        visualize those analyses.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've been primarily using <b>ArcGIS Pro</b> as the platform for geographic analysis and rendering in these
        classes, and have been able to learn a lot of the features of the program by using the ESRI Learning
        modules. The courses I've completed are visible on <a href="ESRI_Learning_Transcript.pdf">my ESRI
        Learning Transcript</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Sample Maps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            In my Geography 181A class, we learned to analyze the slope of a section of land. You can
            take a look at a map of the percent grade of areas within Los Angeles County to see an example
            of what that looks like.
            <br/><br/>
            <object class="pdf" 
                data="LaCountyLandSlope.pdf"
                width="100%"
                height="500">
            </object>
            <br/><br/>
        </li>
        <li>
            I then used that analysis technique, along with a number of the other techniques we learned
            in that class, to analyze the actual difficulties of a variety of ski pistes from resorts
            around the country. As a part of that, I made a map of Bear Mountain Ski Resort from satellite
            imagery annotated with the locations of each of the ski runs listed on the official resort map.
            If you're interested in the methods and results of that project, you can read
            <a href="VarianceBetweenPisteDifficultyRatingsByResort.pdf">the full report</a>.

            <object class="pdf" 
                data="BearMountainNaipImagery.pdf"
                width="100%"
                height="500">
            </object>
            <br/><br/>
        </li>
        <li>
            In my Geography 180 class, I had the chance to look at the median income in every county
            across the United States by creating this map.
            <br/><br/>
            <object class="pdf" 
                data="UsaCountiesMedianIncome.pdf"
                width="100%"
                height="500">
            </object>
            <br/><br/>
        </li>
        <li>
            For the final assignment of my Geography 180 class, I made an interactive web map of Great
            Smoky Mountains National Park. You can see the cartographical choices that make the map
            unique when compared to the official park map on <a href="gsmnp_webmap.html">this page</a>.

        </li>
        <li>
            Although all the above maps were generated with ArcGIS Pro, I've also had the chance to work with
            QGIS, an open source platform for geographic analysis and rendering, my my Geography 7 class. A
            sample of some work that I produced directly in QGIS for that class can be found
            <a href="QgisMappingSample.pdf">here</a>. It takes a look at the amount of water and vegetation in
            various sections of West LA.
        </li>
    </ul>
