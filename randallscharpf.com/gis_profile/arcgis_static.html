    <p>
        In my Geography 180 class, I had the chance to look at the median income in every county
        across the United States by creating this map. (<a href="UsaCountiesMedianIncome.pdf">View&nbsp;as&nbsp;PDF</a>)

    <p>
        In my Geography 181A class, we learned to analyze the slope of a section of land. I made a map of the percent grade
        of the area within Los Angeles County to for an example of what that looks like. (<a href="LaCountyLandSlope.pdf">View&nbsp;as&nbsp;PDF</a>)

    <p>
        I used the aforementioned slope analysis, along with a number of the other techniques I learned in my classes
        in that class, to attempt to compute the difficulties of a variety of ski pistes from resorts
        around the country. As a part of that, I made a map of Bear Mountain Ski Resort from satellite
        imagery annotated with the locations of each of the ski runs listed on the official resort map.

        For details on the methods and results of that project, you can read
        <a href="VarianceBetweenPisteDifficultyRatingsByResort.pdf">my full report</a>, which includes the ski piste map.
        The coolest part of the report are Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, and Table 9, which estimate piste difficulties as
        real numbers instead of as vague categories. Since the difficulty model is based on the ratings at Bear Mountain,
        the decimal difficulty estimates reflect their trails the best.
