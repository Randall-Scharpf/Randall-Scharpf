    <h1>GIS Projects</h1>
    <p>
        I took a group of classes in <b>Geographic Information Systems (GIS)</b> at UCLA. The classes taught me how
        to find geospatial raster and polygon data on the internet, run custom combinations of standard analysis
        tools, and create maps showing that information. I also got to dive into some of the Python interfaces used
        to make and automate those tools.
