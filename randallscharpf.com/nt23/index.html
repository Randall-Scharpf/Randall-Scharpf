    <h1>Northern Tier 2023</h1>
    <p>
        During the 2023 summer, I was one of the staff members at the Ely, MN base for the <a href="https://www.ntier.org/">"Northern Tier" High Adventure Base</a>
        for Scouts. I led 5 crews of scouts from four different states on wilderness treks. I (mostly) made sure nobody got lost in the wilderness, broke our fancy
        gear, got stuck canoeing in circles forever, or was devoid of random fun facts. By my math, I did 141 portages and canoed about 400 miles during the summer.
        It was a lot of fun!
